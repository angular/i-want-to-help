<h1>I Can Help Update Angular's Documentation</h1>

<p>Angular's Documentation can be easily updated by the following process:</p>

<p>Identify a small change in the documentation. Click the friendly blue "Improve this doc" button at the top right of the doc page to fork the repository in-place and make a quick change on the fly.</p>

<p> OR </p>

<p>Identify a larger fix in the documentation. To minimize duplication, go to the issue queue for <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues?milestone=24&state=open" target="_blank">Milestone:Docs Only</a>Comment on an issue to let others know what you're working on, or create a new issue if your work doesn't fit within the scope of any of the existing doc fix projects.</p>

<p>Checkout a new git branch and work on a change. Make a commit of the format "docs(&lt;scope of changes&gt;): &lt; description of changes in the imperative not beginning in capital letter or ending in period and less than 100 characters &gt;". Then <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/contribute" target="_blank">build and test</a> the documentation using "grunt test". Be sure you haven't accidentally introduced any layout or formatting issues.</p>

<p>Push your branch to GitHub with "git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;"</p>

<p>Push your branch to GitHub with "git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;"</p>

<p>If changes are suggested, make the updates, re-run the test suite, and rebase and force push to your GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Be proud that you have improved the documentation for all Angular developers!</p>
